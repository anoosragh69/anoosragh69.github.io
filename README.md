My personal webpage.

The page is not solely my work : the base is a fork of  
https://github.com/hyperterminal-byte/hyperterminal-byte.github.io

and several things have been taken from  

https://github.com/techyminati/techyminati.github.io and

https://github.com/cipheros/cipheros.github.io  

and modified as per my requirement.  

So i obviously have no problems anyone forking my page and using it for them after making obvious changes since I've myself taken 80% stuff from other open source sources including the repos mentioned above and educational sites like w3schools
